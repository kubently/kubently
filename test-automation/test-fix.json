Use `execute_kubectl` with `describe service [service-name] -n [namespace]`.\n2.  **Analyze the `describe` output CRITICALLY**: \n    - **Check `Endpoints`**: If the `Endpoints` field shows `<none>`, this is the primary problem. It means the service has not found any healthy pods matching its selector.\n    - **Check `Selector`**: Note the label selector (e.g., `app=web`).\n    - **Check `TargetPort`**: Note the port the service is trying to send traffic to.\n3.  **Investigate Pods**: If endpoints are `<none>`:\n    - **Verify Pods Exist**: Run `execute_kubectl` with `get pods -l [selector] -n [namespace]`. If this returns no pods, the selector is wrong or no pods are deployed. Report this.\n    - **Verify Pod Port**: If pods *do* exist, `describe` one of them (`describe pod [pod-name] -n [namespace]`) and inspect the `Containers` section to find the `Port` the container is listening on.\n4.  **Synthesize Findings**: Compare the Service's `TargetPort` with the container's `Port`.

Based on the structured output (e.g., `{status: 'NO_ENDPOINTS', reason: 'PORT_MISMATCH'}`), the workflow can transition to a 'Report Fix' node or, if the issue was different (e.g., `{status: 'NO_PODS'}`), it could transition to a 'Deployment Triage Node'.",
