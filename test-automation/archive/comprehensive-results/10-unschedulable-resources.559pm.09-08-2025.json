      "The pod in the `test-scenario-10` namespace is stuck in the Pending state due to scheduling issues. Here's what I found:\n\n- **Reason for Pending State**: The pod cannot be scheduled because there are no available nodes that can accommodate it. Specifically, the error message indicates that \"0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {app: critical}.\"\n\n- **Taint Issue**: The node(s) have a taint `{app: critical}` that the pod does not tolerate, preventing it from being scheduled.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can either:\n1. **Add a Toleration**: Modify the pod's configuration to include a toleration for the taint `{app: critical}`.\n2. **Remove the Taint**: If appropriate, remove the taint from the node(s) to allow the pod to be scheduled.\n\nWould you like more detailed steps on how to apply either of these solutions?"
