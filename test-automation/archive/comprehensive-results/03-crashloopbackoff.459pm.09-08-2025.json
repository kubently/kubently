      "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-6nlcd` in the `test-scenario-03` namespace is failing due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Pod Scheduling Issue**: The pod is currently in a `Pending` state because it cannot be scheduled on any node. The error message indicates that there is a taint on the available node(s) with `{app: critical}` that the pod does not tolerate. This means the pod cannot be scheduled on any node due to this taint.\n\n2. **Container Command Issue**: The container `failing-container` is configured to run a command that intentionally fails: `sh -c \"echo 'I am failing' && exit 1\"`. This command will always result in the container exiting with a failure status.\n\n### Suggested Solutions:\n\n- **Taint Toleration**: If the pod needs to run on nodes with the `{app: critical}` taint, you should add a toleration to the pod's specification to allow it to be scheduled on those nodes. Here is an example of how to add a toleration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  tolerations:\n  - key: \"app\"\n    operator: \"Equal\"\n    value: \"critical\"\n    effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n  ```\n\n- **Fix the Container Command**: If the container is not supposed to fail, you should correct the command that is being executed. For example, if the command is for testing purposes, replace it with the actual command that should be run in production.\n\nWould you like more detailed guidance on how to apply these changes?"
