      "The `internet-client` pod in the `test-scenario-16` namespace is in a `Pending` state due to a scheduling issue. Here's what I found:\n\n- **Pod Scheduling Issue:** The pod is not scheduled because there are no available nodes that can accommodate it. The specific reason is an untolerated taint `{app: critical}` on the node(s).\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Node Taints and Tolerations:**\n   - Check the node taints and consider adding a toleration to the pod if it should run on nodes with the `{app: critical}` taint.\n   - Alternatively, if the taint is not necessary, consider removing it from the node.\n\n2. **Network Configuration:**\n   - Since there are no services in the namespace, ensure that the pod's network configuration allows it to reach external services directly. This might involve checking network policies or configuring a service if needed.\n\nWould you like to proceed with checking the node taints or any other specific action?"
