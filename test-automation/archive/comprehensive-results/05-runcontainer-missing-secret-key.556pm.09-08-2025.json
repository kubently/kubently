      "The pod `missing-secret-key-deployment-646749c486-gktzf` is in a `Pending` state due to a couple of issues:\n\n1. **Environment Variable Issue**: The pod is trying to set an environment variable `API_KEY` from a secret named `app-secret`, but it seems this secret might be missing or not properly configured.\n\n2. **Scheduling Issue**: The pod cannot be scheduled because the available node has a taint `{app: critical}` that the pod does not tolerate. This means the node is marked with a condition that prevents the pod from being scheduled on it.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Check the Secret**: Ensure that the secret `app-secret` exists in the `test-scenario-05` namespace and contains the key `api-key`. You can create or update the secret if it's missing.\n\n- **Node Taint and Toleration**: You need to either:\n  - Remove the taint from the node if it's not necessary.\n  - Add a toleration to the pod's specification to allow it to be scheduled on nodes with the `{app: critical}` taint.\n\nWould you like more detailed guidance on how to address these issues?"
