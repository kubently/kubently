      "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-bdw64` in the `test-scenario-03` namespace is experiencing a `CrashLoopBackOff` due to the container's command causing it to exit with an error. The container is executing the command:\n\n```sh\nsh -c \"echo 'I am failing' && exit 1\"\n```\n\nThis command intentionally exits with a status code of `1`, which is causing the pod to restart repeatedly.\n\n### Solution\nTo resolve this issue, you need to modify the container's command so that it does not exit with an error. Here are a couple of options:\n\n1. **Change the Command**: Update the deployment to use a command that does not exit with an error. For example, you could change it to a long-running process or a simple sleep command:\n   ```yaml\n   command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo 'Running successfully' && sleep 3600\"]\n   ```\n\n2. **Fix the Application Logic**: If the command is part of your application logic, ensure that it completes successfully without exiting with a non-zero status.\n\nYou will need to update the deployment configuration to apply these changes. If you need further assistance with updating the deployment, let me know!"
