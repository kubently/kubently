      "The `server-service` is of type `ClusterIP`, which means it's only reachable from within the cluster. To expose it externally, you would need to change its type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`, or create an Ingress.\n\nAdditionally, I see that the `server-7bd9fd5488-nj4xk` pod is in a `Pending` state. The events show a `FailedScheduling` warning, indicating that \"0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {app: critical}\". This means the pod cannot be scheduled on the available node due to a taint.\n\nTo resolve this, you'll need to either:\n1. Modify the `server` deployment to tolerate the `app: critical` taint.\n2. Remove the `app: critical` taint from the node.\n3. Ensure there's another node without this taint where the pod can be scheduled.\n\nOnce the pod is running, you can then address the external connectivity issue by changing the service type."
