      "The `internet-client` pod is in a `Pending` state because it cannot be scheduled on any node. The reason is that there is a taint on the available node(s) with `{app: critical}`, and the pod does not have a corresponding toleration to allow it to be scheduled on those nodes.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to add a toleration to the pod's specification that matches the taint on the nodes. Here's an example of how you might modify the pod's configuration to include a toleration:\n\n```yaml\ntolerations:\n- key: \"app\"\n  operator: \"Equal\"\n  value: \"critical\"\n  effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n```\n\nYou will need to update the pod's configuration and redeploy it. If you need further assistance with the YAML configuration or any other aspect, feel free to ask!"
