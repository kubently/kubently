      "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-79mzm` in the `test-scenario-03` namespace is failing due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Pod Scheduling Issue**: The pod is in a `Pending` state because it cannot be scheduled on any node. The error message indicates that there is a taint on the node `{app: critical}` that the pod does not tolerate. This means the pod cannot be scheduled on the available node due to this taint.\n\n2. **Container Command Issue**: The container `failing-container` is set to run a command that intentionally fails: `sh -c \"echo 'I am failing' && exit 1\"`. This command will always cause the container to exit with a failure status.\n\n### Suggested Solutions:\n\n1. **Taint Toleration**: \n   - If the pod should run on nodes with the `{app: critical}` taint, you need to add a toleration to the pod's specification to allow it to be scheduled on such nodes. Here is an example of how to add a toleration:\n     ```yaml\n     tolerations:\n     - key: \"app\"\n       operator: \"Equal\"\n       value: \"critical\"\n       effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Fix the Container Command**:\n   - If the command is not supposed to fail, you should correct the command in the container specification. If the failure is intentional for testing, ensure that the environment is set up to handle such failures.\n\nPlease review these suggestions and apply the necessary changes to resolve the issue."
