      "The pod in the `test-scenario-10` namespace is stuck in the Pending state due to resource constraints. Here's what I found:\n\n- **Reason for Pending State:** The pod cannot be scheduled because there are insufficient resources on the available nodes:\n  - **CPU:** Insufficient CPU resources.\n  - **Memory:** Insufficient memory resources.\n\n- **Event Details:**\n  - The scheduler attempted to schedule the pod but found no nodes with enough resources.\n  - No preemption victims were found, meaning the scheduler couldn't free up resources by evicting other pods.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you may need to:\n1. Increase the resource availability on your nodes (e.g., add more nodes or increase node capacity).\n2. Adjust the resource requests/limits for the pod to fit within the available resources.\n3. Consider using node selectors or taints and tolerations to better manage pod placement."
