      "The pod `oom-deployment-58598fb759-dnmsd` in the `test-scenario-06` namespace of the `kind` cluster was terminated due to an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n- **Reason for Termination**: The container `memory-hog` was OOM-killed because the memory limit was too low. The container was trying to execute a command that filled memory (`dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/shm/fill bs=1M count=100`) and was terminated due to exceeding the memory limit.\n- **Memory Limits**: The pod had a memory limit of 15Mi, which was insufficient for the operation it was performing.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nTo prevent the pod from being OOM-killed, you can increase the memory limit for the container. Here are the steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Edit the Deployment**: Increase the memory limit in the deployment configuration.\n2. **Apply the Changes**: Update the deployment with the new configuration.\n\nHere's an example of how you might adjust the memory limits in the deployment YAML:\n\n```yaml\nresources:\n  limits:\n    memory: \"64Mi\"  # Increase this value as needed\n  requests:\n    memory: \"32Mi\"  # Adjust this value as well\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, apply the updated configuration to the cluster. This should help prevent the pod from being terminated due to memory constraints."
