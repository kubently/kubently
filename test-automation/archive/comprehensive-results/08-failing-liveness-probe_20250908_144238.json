      "The pod `liveness-failure-deployment-6c588f4ff5-xh6wn` in the `test-scenario-08` namespace is experiencing restarts due to a failing liveness probe. The probe is configured to check the endpoint `/healthz`, but it is returning a 404 status code, indicating that the endpoint does not exist.\n\n### Key Findings:\n- **Liveness Probe Configuration**: The liveness probe is set to perform an HTTP GET request to `/healthz` on port 80.\n- **Error**: The probe fails with a 404 error because the `/healthz` endpoint is not found on the server.\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n1. **Verify Endpoint**: Ensure that the application running in the pod exposes a `/healthz` endpoint. If not, update the application to include this endpoint.\n2. **Update Liveness Probe**: If the application uses a different health check path, update the liveness probe configuration to match the correct path.\n3. **Check Application Logs**: Review the application logs to ensure it is running as expected and that there are no other underlying issues.\n\nIf you need further assistance with updating the configuration or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
