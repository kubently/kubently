      "The issue with the pod `typo-image-deployment-7dc6b74dcd-8dvfg` in the `test-scenario-01` namespace is due to an incorrect image name. The pod is trying to pull the image `busyboxx:latest`, but it fails because the image name is likely misspelled or does not exist in the repository.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\n1. **Correct the Image Name**: Update the deployment to use the correct image name, which should be `busybox:latest` instead of `busyboxx:latest`.\n\n2. **Redeploy the Pod**: After correcting the image name in the deployment configuration, redeploy the pod to pull the correct image.\n\nIf you have access to modify the deployment, you can update the image name in the deployment's YAML file and apply the changes. If you need further assistance with the YAML update, let me know!"
