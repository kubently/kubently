However, I can only provide diagnostic information and suggestions, as I cannot apply fixes directly.\n\nLet's start by gathering detailed information about the terminated pod, including its events and logs, to understand what might have caused the termination. I'll perform a comprehensive debug on the pod.\n\nPlease provide the name of the pod that was terminated, so I can proceed with the investigation."
