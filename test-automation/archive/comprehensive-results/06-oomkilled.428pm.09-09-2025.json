      "The investigation into the terminated pod in the `test-scenario-06` namespace on the `kind` cluster reveals the following:\n\n### Findings:\n- **Pod Name:** The specific pod name was not provided, but the events suggest it was part of a deployment named `oom-deployment`.\n- **Reason for Termination:** The pod was terminated due to an Out of Memory (OOM) condition. The container within the pod was OOM-killed because the memory limit was too low.\n- **Events:**\n  - The pod was successfully scheduled and started.\n  - The container `memory-hog` was created and started.\n  - The container was OOM-killed, leading to a failure in creating the container task.\n  - The pod then entered a back-off state, attempting to restart the failed container.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\nTo address the OOM issue, you can increase the memory limits for the container in the deployment configuration. Here's a general approach:\n\n1. **Edit the Deployment:**\n   - Increase the memory limits in the deployment's YAML configuration for the container `memory-hog`.\n   - Example:\n     ```yaml\n     resources:\n       limits:\n         memory: \"512Mi\"  # Adjust this value as needed\n       requests:\n         memory: \"256Mi\"  # Adjust this value as needed\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply the Changes:**\n   - Update the deployment with the new configuration using `kubectl apply -f <deployment-file>.yaml`.\n\n3. **Monitor the Pod:**\n   - After applying the changes, monitor the pod to ensure it starts successfully without hitting the memory limit.\n\nIf you need further assistance with the YAML configuration or any other aspect, feel free to ask!"
