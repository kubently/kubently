    "The `rbac-test-pod` in the `test-scenario-19` namespace is currently in a `Pending` state due to scheduling issues. Here are the key findings from the investigation:\n\n- **Service Account:** The pod is using a service account named `limited-sa`.\n- **Pod Status:** Pending\n- **Reason for Pending Status:** The pod cannot be scheduled because there are no available nodes that can accommodate it. Specifically, the node has an untolerated taint `{app: critical}`.\n- **Command in Pod:** The pod is set to run a series of commands to test RBAC permissions, including attempts to get, list, and delete pods, which are expected to fail with a 403 error due to permission restrictions.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Node Taints:** Check the node taints and tolerations. The pod cannot be scheduled because it does not tolerate the taint `{app: critical}`. You may need to adjust the pod's tolerations or modify the node's taints.\n\n2. **RBAC Permissions:** The pod is designed to test RBAC permissions. If the permission errors are expected (as part of a test), ensure that the service account `limited-sa` has the necessary permissions for the operations you intend to allow.\n\n3. **Service Account and Role Bindings:** Review the role bindings associated with the `limited-sa` service account to ensure it has the appropriate permissions for the actions it needs to perform.\n\nIf you need further assistance with specific RBAC configurations or node taint adjustments, let me know!"
