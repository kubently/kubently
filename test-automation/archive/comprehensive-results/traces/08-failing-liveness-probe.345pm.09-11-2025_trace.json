    "The pod `liveness-failure-deployment-6c588f4ff5-5pj87` in cluster `kind`, namespace `test-scenario-08` is restarting because its liveness probe is failing.\n\nThe logs show that the probe is trying to access `/healthz`, but this file or directory does not exist:\n`open() \"/usr/share/nginx/html/healthz\" failed (2: No such file or directory)`\n\nTo fix this, you would need to either:\n1.  Ensure that the `/usr/share/nginx/html/healthz` file exists within the pod's container and returns a successful status (e.g., HTTP 200).\n2.  Modify the deployment's liveness probe configuration to point to the correct health check endpoint or remove it if not needed.\n\nAs a read-only debugging agent, I cannot directly modify the cluster to fix this."
