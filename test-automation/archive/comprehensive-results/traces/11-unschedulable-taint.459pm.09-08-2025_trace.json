    "The pod in the `test-scenario-11` namespace is not found, but there are events related to a scheduling issue for a pod named `no-toleration-deployment-6fdc58944f-vhnnb`. Here's what I found:\n\n- **Failed Scheduling**: The pod is unable to be scheduled because there are no available nodes that can accommodate it. Specifically, the issue is due to a taint on the node `{app: critical}` that the pod does not tolerate.\n- **Preemption**: Preemption is not helpful in this case, meaning that even removing other pods wouldn't help in scheduling this pod.\n\nTo resolve this, you may need to:\n1. Add a toleration to the pod's specification to tolerate the taint `{app: critical}`.\n2. Alternatively, if appropriate, remove or adjust the taint on the node to allow the pod to be scheduled.\n\nIf you need further assistance with modifying the pod's configuration or understanding taints and tolerations, let me know!"
