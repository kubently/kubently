    "It seems there is a technical issue with the tool I attempted to use for debugging. However, based on the error `CreateContainerConfigError`, the issue is likely related to a missing or misconfigured ConfigMap.\n\nTo resolve this, you should:\n1. Check if the ConfigMap referenced by the pod exists in the `test-scenario-04` namespace.\n2. Verify that the pod's configuration correctly references the ConfigMap.\n3. Ensure that any required environment variables or volume mounts are correctly specified.\n\nIf you need further assistance, you might want to manually inspect the pod's configuration and events using `kubectl describe pod missing-configmap-deployment-56f64d6d65-v29ls -n test-scenario-04` in your terminal."
