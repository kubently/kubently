    "There are no events available in the `test-scenario-06` namespace, which suggests that either the events have expired or the namespace is not currently active.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to address the issue:\n\n1. **Check Pod Configuration**: Ensure that the pod's configuration (e.g., deployment or stateful set) is correct and that it is set to automatically restart if terminated.\n\n2. **Review Resource Quotas**: Verify if there are any resource quotas or limits in the namespace that might have caused the pod to be terminated.\n\n3. **Examine Cluster Logs**: Check the cluster's logs for any system-level issues that might have affected the pod.\n\n4. **Redeploy the Pod**: If the pod was part of a deployment, you can try redeploying it to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf you have more specific details about the pod or if it reappears, feel free to provide them, and I can assist further."
