    "The pod `high-resources-deployment-5d89dd88f8-rplss` in namespace `test-scenario-10` (cluster `kind`) is stuck in `Pending` state because no nodes have sufficient CPU and memory resources to accommodate its requests.\n\nThe pod is requesting:\n*   **CPU:** 1k (which is 1000 cores)\n*   **Memory:** 500Gi\n\nThe scheduler reports: `0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient cpu, 1 Insufficient memory.` This indicates that the single node in your `kind` cluster does not have 1000 CPU cores and 500Gi of memory available."
