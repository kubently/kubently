    "It seems there is a technical issue with the tool I attempted to use for debugging. However, based on the information that the pod cannot start due to a missing secret key, here's a general approach to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Missing Secret**: Check the pod's configuration to identify which secret is missing. This can typically be found in the pod's `spec` under `volumes` or `envFrom`.\n\n2. **Verify Secret Existence**: Use the following command to list secrets in the `test-scenario-05` namespace and verify if the required secret exists:\n   ```bash\n   kubectl get secrets -n test-scenario-05\n   ```\n\n3. **Create or Update the Secret**: If the secret is missing, create it using:\n   ```bash\n   kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value> -n test-scenario-05\n   ```\n   If the secret exists but is missing keys, update it using:\n   ```bash\n   kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<missing-key>=<value> -n test-scenario-05 --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -\n   ```\n\n4. **Redeploy the Pod**: After ensuring the secret is correctly configured, delete the problematic pod to allow it to restart:\n   ```bash\n   kubectl delete pod missing-secret-key-deployment-646749c486-fq9zb -n test-scenario-05\n   ```\n\nThis should resolve the issue if the problem is indeed due to a missing secret key. If you need further assistance or specific details, please let me know!"
