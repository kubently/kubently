    "The pod `readiness-failure-deployment-8ddf69f95-9mwkl` in the `test-scenario-07` namespace is experiencing readiness probe failures. The readiness probe is configured to check the `/ready` endpoint on port 80, but this endpoint is returning a 404 status code, indicating it does not exist.\n\nTo resolve this issue:\n1. Ensure that the application is configured to serve a readiness endpoint at `/ready`. If not, update the application configuration.\n2. If the application uses a different endpoint for readiness checks, update the readiness probe configuration in the deployment to match the correct endpoint.\n\nThese steps should help resolve the readiness issue."
