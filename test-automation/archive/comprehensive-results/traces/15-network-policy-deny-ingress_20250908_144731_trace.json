    "Here's what I found in the `test-scenario-15` namespace of the `kind` cluster:\n\n1. **Services:**\n   - `server-service`: This is a `ClusterIP` service with no external IP, which means it is only accessible within the cluster. It is listening on port 80.\n\n2. **Ingress:**\n   - No ingress resources are configured in this namespace.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The absence of an ingress resource suggests that there is no external entry point configured for accessing the application from outside the cluster.\n- The `ClusterIP` service type is not accessible from outside the cluster by default.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- If you need external access, consider setting up an ingress resource or changing the service type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` (if supported by your environment).\n- Ensure that any ingress controller is properly configured and running if you decide to use ingress resources.\n\nWould you like assistance in setting up an ingress resource or further investigation into other potential issues?"
