    "It seems there was an error retrieving information because the namespace `test-scenario-02` was not found in the `kind` cluster. This could mean that the namespace does not exist, or there might be a typo in the namespace name.\n\nPlease verify the namespace name and ensure it exists in the cluster. If the namespace is correct and should exist, you might want to check if there are any issues with the cluster's configuration or permissions. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
