    "It seems there is a technical issue with the tool I attempted to use for a deeper investigation. However, based on the error `CreateContainerConfigError`, the pod `missing-configmap-deployment-56f64d6d65-hwknv` is likely missing a required ConfigMap or secret.\n\nTo resolve this, you should:\n1. Check if the ConfigMap or secret referenced by the pod exists in the `test-scenario-04` namespace.\n2. Ensure that the pod's configuration correctly references the existing ConfigMap or secret.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific details, please let me know!"
