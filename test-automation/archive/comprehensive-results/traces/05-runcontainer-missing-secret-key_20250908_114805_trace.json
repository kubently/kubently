    "It seems there is a persistent issue with the tool execution. However, based on the error message \"CreateContainerConfigError,\" it indicates that the pod is unable to start due to a configuration issue, likely related to a missing secret key.\n\n### Likely Issue:\nThe pod is configured to use a secret that is either not created or not correctly referenced in the pod's configuration.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\n1. **Check the Pod's Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that the pod's configuration (usually in a Deployment or StatefulSet) correctly references the secret by name.\n\n2. **Verify the Secret Exists:**\n   - Run `kubectl get secrets -n test-scenario-05` to list all secrets in the namespace and verify that the required secret is present.\n\n3. **Create or Update the Secret:**\n   - If the secret is missing, create it using:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value> -n test-scenario-05\n     ```\n   - If the secret exists but is incorrect, update it using:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl delete secret <secret-name> -n test-scenario-05\n     kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value> -n test-scenario-05\n     ```\n\n4. **Redeploy the Pod:**\n   - After ensuring the secret is correctly configured, redeploy the pod or the deployment to apply the changes.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific command outputs, please let me know!"
