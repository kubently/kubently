    "The pod `oom-deployment-58598fb759-5grt5` is experiencing an `OOM-killed` error, which means it was terminated because it exceeded its memory limit. Here are the key findings:\n\n- **Memory Limits**: The pod has a memory limit of 15Mi, which is quite low.\n- **Command**: The container runs a command that attempts to allocate 100Mi of memory (`dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/shm/fill bs=1M count=100`), which exceeds the set memory limit.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nTo resolve this issue, you should increase the memory limit for the container. Here\u2019s a general approach:\n\n1. **Edit the Deployment**: Increase the memory limit in the deployment configuration to a value that accommodates the memory usage of the application. For example, you might set it to 150Mi or higher, depending on your application's needs.\n\n2. **Apply the Changes**: Update the deployment with the new configuration.\n\nIf you need further assistance with the specific steps to update the deployment configuration, feel free to ask!"
