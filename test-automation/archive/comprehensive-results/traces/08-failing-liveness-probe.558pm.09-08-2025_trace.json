    "The pod `liveness-failure-deployment-6c588f4ff5-c5qbg` in the `test-scenario-08` namespace is currently in a `Pending` state due to scheduling issues. Here's what I found:\n\n- **Reason for Pending Status**: The pod is unable to be scheduled because there are no available nodes that can accommodate it. Specifically, the node has an untolerated taint `{app: critical}` which is preventing the pod from being scheduled.\n\n- **Liveness Probe**: The pod has a liveness probe configured, but since it is in a `Pending` state, the probe hasn't been executed yet.\n\n- **Events**: The scheduler has reported that no nodes are available due to the untolerated taint.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you would need to either:\n1. **Remove or Modify the Taint** on the node to allow the pod to be scheduled.\n2. **Add a Toleration** to the pod's configuration to tolerate the existing taint on the node.\n\nSince I operate in a read-only mode, I can't make these changes directly. You might want to check the node's taints and adjust the pod's tolerations accordingly. If you need further assistance with how to do this, feel free to ask!"
