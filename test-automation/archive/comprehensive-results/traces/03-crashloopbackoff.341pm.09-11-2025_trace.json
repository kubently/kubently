    "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-zkg6w` in namespace `test-scenario-03` (cluster `kind`) is restarting because its container, `failing-container`, is intentionally exiting with an error.\n\nThe container's command is `sh -c echo 'I am failing' && exit 1`, which explicitly causes it to terminate with an exit code of 1. Kubernetes interprets a non-zero exit code as a failure, leading to the pod restarting in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state.\n\n**Solution:** To resolve this, you need to modify the deployment's container command to either run a long-running process or ensure it exits with a status code of 0 upon successful completion. For example, you could change the command to `sh -c 'while true; do echo \"I am running\"; sleep 5; done'` for a simple long-running process."
