    "The pod `missing-secret-key-deployment-646749c486-f8vgq` is failing to start due to a missing key in a Kubernetes Secret. Specifically, the error message indicates that the key `api-key` is not found in the Secret `app-secret` in the `test-scenario-05` namespace.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the Secret `app-secret` contains the key `api-key`. Here are the steps you can take:\n\n1. **Check the Secret**: Verify if the Secret `app-secret` exists in the `test-scenario-05` namespace and contains the `api-key`.\n2. **Create or Update the Secret**: If the Secret is missing or does not contain the `api-key`, you will need to create or update it with the correct key-value pair.\n\nSince I can only provide diagnostic information, you'll need to perform these steps using your Kubernetes management tools or CLI. If you need further assistance with the commands to create or update the Secret, feel free to ask!"
