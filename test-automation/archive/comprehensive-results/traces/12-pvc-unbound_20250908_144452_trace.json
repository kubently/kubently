    "It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from accessing the persistent volume claims in the `test-scenario-12` namespace. The service account I'm using doesn't have the necessary permissions to list these resources.\n\nTo proceed, you might want to check the following on your end:\n1. **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** Ensure that the PVCs are bound and in a healthy state.\n2. **Persistent Volumes (PVs):** Verify that the PVs are available and not in a failed state.\n3. **Access Permissions:** Check if the application has the necessary permissions to access the storage.\n\nIf you can adjust the permissions or provide more details, I can assist further in diagnosing the issue."
