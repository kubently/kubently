    "The `rbac-test-pod` is experiencing scheduling issues due to a node taint (`app: critical`) that it cannot tolerate. This is preventing the pod from being scheduled on any available nodes.\n\nAdditionally, the pod is using a service account named `limited-sa`, which might have restricted permissions. The pod's command attempts to perform several actions, such as getting and listing pods, and deleting a pod, which are expected to fail with a `403 Forbidden` error due to insufficient permissions.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Node Taint Tolerance**: \n   - Ensure that the pod can tolerate the node taint `app: critical` if it needs to run on those nodes. You can add a toleration to the pod specification to allow it to be scheduled on nodes with this taint.\n\n2. **Service Account Permissions**:\n   - Review the `Role` or `ClusterRole` associated with the `limited-sa` service account. Ensure it has the necessary permissions to perform the required actions (e.g., `get`, `list`, `delete` on pods).\n\n3. **RBAC Configuration**:\n   - If the service account needs broader permissions, consider updating the `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` to grant the necessary access.\n\nThese steps should help address the permission errors and scheduling issues. If you need further assistance with specific RBAC configurations, let me know!"
