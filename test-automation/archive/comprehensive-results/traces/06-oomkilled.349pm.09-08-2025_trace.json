    "It seems that the `test-scenario-06` namespace does not exist in the `kind` cluster, which is why I couldn't retrieve any information about the pod. This could mean that the namespace was deleted, or there might have been a typo in the namespace name.\n\nPlease verify the namespace name or check if it has been removed. If you have any additional details or corrections, let me know, and I can assist further."
