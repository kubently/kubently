    "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-pdx5m` in the `test-scenario-03` namespace is failing due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Pod Scheduling Issue**: The pod is in a `Pending` state because it cannot be scheduled on any node. The error message indicates that there is a taint on the node `{app: critical}` that the pod cannot tolerate. This means the node is marked with a taint that prevents the pod from being scheduled unless it has a matching toleration.\n\n2. **Container Command Failure**: The container `failing-container` is set to run a command that intentionally fails: `sh -c \"echo 'I am failing' && exit 1\"`. This command will always cause the container to exit with a failure status.\n\n### Suggested Solutions:\n\n- **Taint and Toleration**: \n  - If the pod should run on nodes with the `{app: critical}` taint, add a toleration to the pod's specification to match this taint.\n  - Alternatively, if the taint is not necessary, consider removing it from the node.\n\n- **Container Command**:\n  - Modify the container's command to prevent it from exiting with a failure status. For example, change the command to something that does not include `exit 1`.\n\nWould you like guidance on how to apply these changes?"
