    "The service `server-service` in the `test-scenario-15` namespace is of type `ClusterIP`, which means it is only accessible within the cluster and not from outside. To make the application accessible externally, you might consider changing the service type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`, depending on your cluster setup and requirements. \n\nIf you need further assistance or a deeper investigation, please let me know!"
