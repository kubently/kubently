    "It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from accessing the persistent volume claims in the `test-scenario-12` namespace. The service account I'm using doesn't have the necessary permissions to list these resources.\n\nTo proceed, you might want to check the following on your end:\n1. **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** Ensure that the PVCs in the `test-scenario-12` namespace are bound and not in a pending state.\n2. **Persistent Volumes (PVs):** Verify that the PVs are available and not in a failed state.\n3. **Storage Class:** Check if the storage class used by the PVCs is correctly configured and available.\n\nIf you have access, you can run the following commands to gather more information:\n- `kubectl get pvc -n test-scenario-12`\n- `kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name> -n test-scenario-12`\n- `kubectl get pv`\n- `kubectl describe pv <pv-name>`\n\nThese commands will help you identify any issues with the storage resources. If you need further assistance interpreting the results, feel free to share them here!"
