    "I can help identify the root cause of the ImagePullBackOff issue, but I won't be able to fix it directly as I operate in a read-only mode. Let's start by identifying the failing resources in the `test-scenario-01` namespace.\n\nFirst, I need to know which cluster you're referring to. If you haven't specified a cluster yet, I'll list the available clusters for you to choose from. Could you please specify the cluster, or should I list the available clusters?"
