    "It seems that the pod you mentioned is no longer present in the `test-scenario-06` namespace, as indicated by the \"NotFound\" error. However, I was able to retrieve some events related to a pod named `oom-deployment-58598fb759-9zh5n`, which might be related to your issue. Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Failed Scheduling**: The pod faced a scheduling issue due to a node taint (`app: critical`) that was not tolerated by the pod. This means the pod could not be scheduled on any available nodes because of this taint.\n\n2. **Successful Creation and Scaling**: The pod was successfully created and scaled up by the deployment, but it seems it couldn't be scheduled due to the taint issue.\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n- **Check Node Taints**: Review the taints on your nodes and ensure that your pods have the necessary tolerations to be scheduled on those nodes.\n- **Add Tolerations**: If the taint is intentional and necessary, consider adding a toleration to your pod specification to allow it to be scheduled on nodes with the `app: critical` taint.\n- **Review Resource Requests**: Ensure that the pod's resource requests and limits are appropriate for the available nodes.\n\nIf you need further assistance with specific configurations or have more details about the pod, feel free to share!"
