    "The issue with the pod in the \"test-scenario-01\" namespace on the \"kind\" cluster is due to an incorrect image name. Here's what I found:\n\n- The pod is trying to pull the image \"busyboxx:latest\".\n- The error message indicates that the image \"busyboxx:latest\" could not be found: `failed to resolve reference \"docker.io/library/busyboxx:latest\": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization`.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\n- **Correct the Image Name**: It seems like there's a typo in the image name. The correct image name should likely be \"busybox:latest\" instead of \"busyboxx:latest\".\n- **Update the Deployment**: You will need to update the deployment or pod specification to use the correct image name.\n\nIf you have access to modify the deployment, you can update the image name in the deployment configuration and apply the changes. If you need further assistance with the steps to update the deployment, feel free to ask!"
