    "The pods in the `test-scenario-13` namespace are in a `Pending` state because there are no available nodes that can schedule them. The specific issue is that the nodes have a taint `{app: critical}` which the pods do not tolerate.\n\nTo resolve this, you can either:\n1. Add a toleration to the pod spec to tolerate the taint `{app: critical}`.\n2. Remove or adjust the taint on the nodes if it's appropriate for your use case.\n\nWould you like more detailed guidance on how to apply either of these solutions?"
