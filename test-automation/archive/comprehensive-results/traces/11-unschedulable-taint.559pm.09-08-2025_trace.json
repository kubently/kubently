    "The pod in the `test-scenario-11` namespace is not found, but there is a related scheduling issue with a pod named `no-toleration-deployment-6fdc58944f-7r6pv`. Here's what I found:\n\n- **Failed Scheduling**: The pod `no-toleration-deployment-6fdc58944f-7r6pv` is unable to be scheduled because there are no available nodes that can tolerate the taint `{app: critical}`. This means that the node(s) have a taint that the pod does not tolerate, preventing it from being scheduled.\n\n- **Events**:\n  - **Warning**: 0/1 nodes are available due to the untolerated taint.\n  - **Normal**: The pod was successfully created by the replicaset, but it cannot be scheduled due to the taint issue.\n\nTo resolve this, you may need to:\n1. Add a toleration to the pod spec to tolerate the taint `{app: critical}`.\n2. Remove or modify the taint on the node if appropriate.\n\nIf you need further assistance with modifying the pod or node configurations, let me know!"
