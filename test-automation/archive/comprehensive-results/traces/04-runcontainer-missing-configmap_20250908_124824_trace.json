    "It seems there is a technical issue with the tool I attempted to use for a deeper investigation. However, based on the error `CreateContainerConfigError`, the issue is likely related to a missing or misconfigured ConfigMap.\n\nTo resolve this, you should:\n1. Check if the ConfigMap referenced by the pod exists in the `test-scenario-04` namespace.\n2. Verify that the pod's configuration correctly references the ConfigMap.\n3. Ensure that any environment variables or volume mounts using the ConfigMap are correctly specified.\n\nIf you need further assistance, please let me know!"
