    "The pod `readiness-failure-deployment-8ddf69f95-527ql` in namespace `test-scenario-07` (cluster `kind`) is running but not ready because its readiness probe is failing.\n\nThe readiness probe is configured to perform an HTTP GET request to the `/ready` path on port 80. The events show repeated warnings: `Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 404`. This indicates that the Nginx container is not serving content at the `/ready` endpoint, causing the probe to fail.\n\nTo resolve this, you would need to either:\n1.  **Modify the Nginx configuration** within the pod to serve a response (even an empty one) at the `/ready` path.\n2.  **Adjust the readiness probe definition** in the pod's deployment to target a path that Nginx is already serving (e.g., `/`).\n\nAs a read-only debugging agent, I cannot directly modify the cluster configuration to implement these changes."
