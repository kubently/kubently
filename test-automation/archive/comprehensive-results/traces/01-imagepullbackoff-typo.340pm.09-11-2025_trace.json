    "The pod `typo-image-deployment-7dc6b74dcd-lz7dh` in namespace `test-scenario-01` on cluster `kind` is in an `ErrImagePull` state.\n\nThe `describe` command output shows that the container `busybox` is trying to pull the image `busyboxx:latest`. The `Events` section confirms the `Back-off pulling image \"busyboxx:latest\"` and `Error: ImagePullBackOff`.\n\nThis indicates that the image name `busyboxx:latest` is incorrect. It should likely be `busybox:latest`.\n\nAs a read-only debugging agent, I cannot directly fix the issue. To resolve this, you will need to update the deployment to use the correct image name (`busybox:latest`)."
