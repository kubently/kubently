    "The `app-service` in `test-scenario-13` (cluster `kind`) has no endpoints, meaning no pods are currently backing it. I found two pods, `app-deployment-57797f48c9-cv6c5` and `app-deployment-57797f48c9-hnkz8`, that match the service's `app=my-service` selector, but both are in a `Pending` state and `0/1` ready.\n\nThis indicates the pods are not running. I will now investigate why the pods are pending."
