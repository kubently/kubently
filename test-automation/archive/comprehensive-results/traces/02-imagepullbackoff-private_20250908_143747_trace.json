    "The pod `private-registry-deployment-5bd5448588-n5dn2` in the `test-scenario-02` namespace is stuck in the `ImagePullBackOff` state due to an authorization issue when trying to pull the image from the Google Container Registry (GCR).\n\n### Diagnosis:\n- **Image:** `gcr.io/private-project/private-app:latest`\n- **Error:** Failed to authorize the image pull request, resulting in a `403 Forbidden` error. This typically indicates that the Kubernetes cluster does not have the necessary permissions to access the private image in GCR.\n\n### Suggested Resolution Steps:\n1. **Check Image Pull Secrets:**\n   - Ensure that a Kubernetes secret containing the necessary credentials for accessing the private GCR is created in the `test-scenario-02` namespace.\n   - The secret should be of type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`.\n\n2. **Attach the Secret to the Pod:**\n   - Update the deployment to use the image pull secret by adding it to the `imagePullSecrets` field in the pod specification.\n\n3. **Verify GCR Permissions:**\n   - Ensure that the service account used by the Kubernetes cluster has the necessary permissions to pull images from the specified GCR repository.\n\n4. **Re-deploy the Pod:**\n   - After updating the secrets and permissions, re-deploy the pod to attempt pulling the image again.\n\nIf you need further assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask!"
