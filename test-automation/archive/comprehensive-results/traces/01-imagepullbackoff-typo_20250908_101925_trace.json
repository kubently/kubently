    "It seems there is a technical issue with the tool I am using to debug the pod. However, I can guide you on how to manually check and resolve the `ImagePullBackOff` issue.\n\n### Steps to Identify and Fix the Issue:\n\n1. **Check Pod Events:**\n   - Run the following command to get detailed events for the pod:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl describe pod typo-image-deployment-7dc6b74dcd-66kbx -n test-scenario-01\n     ```\n   - Look for events related to image pulling. Common issues include incorrect image names, tags, or authentication problems.\n\n2. **Verify Image Name and Tag:**\n   - Ensure that the image name and tag specified in the pod's container spec are correct. This can be checked in the pod's YAML or deployment configuration.\n\n3. **Check Image Registry Access:**\n   - If the image is hosted on a private registry, ensure that the necessary image pull secrets are configured in the namespace:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl get secrets -n test-scenario-01\n     ```\n   - If needed, create or update the image pull secret:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl create secret docker-registry myregistrykey --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<your-username> --docker-password=<your-password> --docker-email=<your-email> -n test-scenario-01\n     ```\n\n4. **Correct the Image Reference:**\n   - If there is a typo or incorrect reference in the image name, update the deployment or pod spec with the correct image name and redeploy.\n\n5. **Re-deploy the Pod:**\n   - After making corrections, delete the problematic pod to allow the deployment to create a new one:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl delete pod typo-image-deployment-7dc6b74dcd-66kbx -n test-scenario-01\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the `ImagePullBackOff` issue.
