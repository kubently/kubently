    "The pod `missing-configmap-deployment-56f64d6d65-4b9w5` in the `test-scenario-04` namespace is failing to start due to a missing ConfigMap named `app-config`. The error `CreateContainerConfigError` indicates that the container is unable to start because it relies on this ConfigMap for its environment variables, and it is marked as non-optional.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should:\n\n1. Verify if the ConfigMap `app-config` exists in the `test-scenario-04` namespace.\n2. If it doesn't exist, create the ConfigMap with the necessary configuration.\n3. If it exists, ensure that the pod has the correct permissions and configuration to access it.\n\nWould you like further assistance with any of these steps?"
