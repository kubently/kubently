    "It appears that the `web-service` in the `test-scenario-14` namespace has no active endpoints, meaning there are no pods backing the service. This is the most likely cause of the connectivity issue.\n\nThe service is configured to select pods with the label `app=web`. I will now check for pods with this label in the `test-scenario-14` namespace to see if they exist and are running."
