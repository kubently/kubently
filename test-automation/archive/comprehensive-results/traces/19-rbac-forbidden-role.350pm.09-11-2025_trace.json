    "The `rbac-test-pod` in the `test-scenario-19` namespace is in a `Pending` state and is not scheduled due to a taint on the node. The error message \"0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {app: critical}\" indicates that the pod cannot be scheduled on the available node because it does not tolerate the `app: critical` taint.\n\nTo resolve this, you would typically need to either:\n1. Add a toleration for `app: critical` to the `rbac-test-pod`'s definition.\n2. Schedule the pod on a node that does not have this taint.\n3. Remove the taint from the node if it's no longer needed.\n\nHowever, as a read-only debugging agent, I cannot modify the cluster state. I can only provide information.\n\nThe pod's command also indicates that it's designed to test RBAC permissions and will intentionally fail when trying to list or delete pods, which is expected behavior given the \"permission errors\" mentioned in your initial request. The current issue preventing the pod from even starting is the scheduling problem."
