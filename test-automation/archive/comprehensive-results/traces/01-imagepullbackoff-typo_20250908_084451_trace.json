    "The `ImagePullBackOff` issue for the pod `typo-image-deployment-7dc6b74dcd-dvrrj` in the `test-scenario-01` namespace is due to a typo in the image name. The pod is trying to pull the image `busyboxx:latest`, but it should be `busybox:latest`.\n\n### Root Cause:\n- The image name `busyboxx:latest` is incorrect. The correct image name is `busybox:latest`.\n\n### Fix:\n- Update the deployment to use the correct image name `busybox:latest`.\n\nYou can fix this by editing the deployment configuration to correct the image name. Here's a high-level command you might use:\n\n```bash\nkubectl set image deployment/typo-image-deployment busybox=busybox:latest -n test-scenario-01\n```\n\nThis command updates the image for the `busybox` container in the `typo-image-deployment` deployment to the correct `busybox:latest` image."
