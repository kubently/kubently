    "The pod `readiness-failure-deployment-8ddf69f95-4dd99` in the `test-scenario-07` namespace is running but not ready due to a failing readiness probe. Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n- **Readiness Probe Configuration**: The pod has an HTTP readiness probe configured to check the `/ready` endpoint on port 80.\n- **Failure Reason**: The readiness probe is failing with a 404 status code, indicating that the `/ready` endpoint does not exist or is not correctly configured in the Nginx server.\n\n### Recommendations to Resolve the Issue:\n1. **Check Nginx Configuration**: Ensure that the Nginx configuration includes a route for the `/ready` endpoint. You may need to add a location block in the Nginx configuration file to handle requests to `/ready`.\n\n2. **Update Readiness Probe**: If the `/ready` endpoint is not intended to exist, update the readiness probe to check an existing endpoint that can accurately reflect the readiness of the application.\n\n3. **Verify Application Deployment**: Ensure that the application is correctly deployed and that all necessary files and configurations are in place.\n\nBy addressing the readiness probe configuration or the Nginx setup, you should be able to resolve the readiness issue. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
