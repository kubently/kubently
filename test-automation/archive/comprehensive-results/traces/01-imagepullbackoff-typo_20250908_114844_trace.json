    "It seems there is a technical issue with the tool I am using to debug the pod. However, I can guide you on how to manually check and resolve the ImagePullBackOff issue.\n\n### Steps to Identify and Fix ImagePullBackOff:\n\n1. **Check Pod Description:**\n   - Run the following command to get detailed information about the pod:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl describe pod typo-image-deployment-7dc6b74dcd-hq8xh -n test-scenario-01\n     ```\n   - Look for the \"Events\" section at the bottom. It will provide specific error messages related to the image pull failure.\n\n2. **Common Causes and Fixes:**\n   - **Incorrect Image Name/Tag:**\n     - Ensure the image name and tag are correct in your deployment configuration.\n   - **Authentication Issues:**\n     - If the image is hosted on a private registry, ensure that the Kubernetes secret for the registry credentials is correctly configured and referenced in your pod spec.\n   - **Network Issues:**\n     - Verify that the nodes can reach the image registry. Check for any network policies or firewall rules that might be blocking access.\n\n3. **Update Deployment:**\n   - If you identify an issue with the image name or tag, update your deployment with the correct image:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl set image deployment/typo-image-deployment <container-name>=<correct-image>:<tag> -n test-scenario-01\n     ```\n\nIf you need further assistance or if the issue persists, please let me know!"
