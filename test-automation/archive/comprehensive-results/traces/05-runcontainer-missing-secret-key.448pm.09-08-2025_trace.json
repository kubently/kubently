    "It appears that there are no pods currently present in the `test-scenario-05` namespace of the `kind` cluster. This could mean that the pod has not been created yet, or it might have been deleted.\n\nTo proceed, please check if the pod was supposed to be created by a deployment or another controller. If you have any specific details about the pod or its configuration, let me know, and I can help further diagnose the issue."
