    "The issue with the service in the `test-scenario-13` namespace seems to be related to the pods not being scheduled rather than the service itself. Here's what I found:\n\n- **Pods Status**: The pods `app-deployment-57797f48c9-5285n` and `app-deployment-57797f48c9-ptqch` are in a `Pending` state.\n- **Reason for Pending**: The scheduler is unable to place the pods on any node because of a taint on the available node(s). Specifically, the taint `{app: critical}` is not tolerated by the pods, preventing them from being scheduled.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Check Node Taints**: Verify the taints on your nodes and consider adding a toleration to your pod spec if the taint is intentional and necessary.\n2. **Add Tolerations**: If the taint is `{app: critical}`, you can add a toleration to your pod spec to allow scheduling:\n   ```yaml\n   tolerations:\n   - key: \"app\"\n     operator: \"Equal\"\n     value: \"critical\"\n     effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n   ```\n3. **Node Availability**: Ensure that there are nodes available that can accept the pods, either by removing unnecessary taints or by adding more nodes.\n\nWould you like further assistance with modifying the deployment or checking node configurations?"
