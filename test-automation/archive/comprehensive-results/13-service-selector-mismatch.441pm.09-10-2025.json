      "The pods in the `test-scenario-13` namespace are running and ready, but they have the label `app=my-app`, which does not match the service's selector `app=my-service`. This mismatch is why the service has no endpoints and traffic isn't reaching the pods.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to update either the service's selector to match the pods' labels or update the pods' labels to match the service's selector. Since I operate in a read-only mode, you will need to make this change manually."
