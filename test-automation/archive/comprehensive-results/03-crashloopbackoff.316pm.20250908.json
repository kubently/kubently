      "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-zfxsc` in the `test-scenario-03` namespace is failing due to two main issues:\n\n1. **Command Failure**: The container `failing-container` is set to execute the command `sh -c \"echo 'I am failing' && exit 1\"`, which intentionally exits with a status of 1, causing the pod to crash.\n\n2. **Scheduling Issue**: The pod is not being scheduled because there is a taint on the node `{app: critical}` that the pod does not tolerate. This means the pod cannot be scheduled on any available nodes due to this taint.\n\n### Suggested Solutions:\n\n- **Fix the Command**: Modify the container's command to prevent it from exiting with a non-zero status. For example, change the command to something that does not exit with an error, like `sh -c \"echo 'I am running successfully'\"`.\n\n- **Tolerate the Taint**: If the pod needs to run on nodes with the `{app: critical}` taint, you should add a toleration to the pod's specification to allow it to be scheduled on those nodes. Here is an example of how to add a toleration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  tolerations:\n  - key: \"app\"\n    operator: \"Equal\"\n    value: \"critical\"\n    effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n  ```\n\nImplementing these changes should help resolve the issues with the pod."
