However, it also identified that the pod is `Pending` because it cannot be scheduled due to a node taint (`{app: critical}`). While both aspects are present in the scenario (RBAC is intentionally restricted for testing, and a node taint exists), the primary issue preventing the application from running *and therefore triggering the RBAC errors* is the unschedulable pod due to the taint. The agent didn't prioritize or emphasize this root cause effectively. It treats the RBAC permissions as an equal, if not primary, issue.",
