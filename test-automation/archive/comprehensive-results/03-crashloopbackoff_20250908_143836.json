      "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-vgq69` in the `test-scenario-03` namespace is experiencing a `CrashLoopBackOff` due to the container's command intentionally exiting with an error. Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n- **Container Command**: The container is executing the command `sh -c \"echo 'I am failing' && exit 1\"`, which prints a message and then exits with a status code of 1, causing the pod to fail and restart.\n- **Exit Code**: The container exits with code 1, indicating an error.\n- **Restart Count**: The container has restarted multiple times due to this error.\n\n### Solution\nTo resolve this issue, you need to modify the container's command so that it does not exit with an error. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Change the Command**: Update the deployment to use a command that does not exit with an error. For example, you could change it to a long-running process or a command that completes successfully.\n\n2. **Debugging**: If the command is meant to perform a specific task, ensure that the task completes successfully without errors.\n\n3. **Configuration Update**: If the command is correct but the environment or configuration is causing the failure, adjust the necessary configurations or environment variables.\n\nSince I operate in a read-only mode, you'll need to apply these changes to the deployment configuration in your cluster. If you need further assistance with the configuration, feel free to ask!"
