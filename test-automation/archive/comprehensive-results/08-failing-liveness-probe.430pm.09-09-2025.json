      "The pod `liveness-failure-deployment-6c588f4ff5-pd6l5` in the `test-scenario-08` namespace is experiencing restarts due to a failing liveness probe. The probe is configured to check the endpoint `/healthz`, but it is returning a 404 error because the file or endpoint does not exist on the server.\n\n### Key Findings:\n- **Liveness Probe Configuration**: The liveness probe is set to perform an HTTP GET request on `/healthz` every 5 seconds, starting 10 seconds after the container starts.\n- **Error**: The probe fails with a 404 status code, indicating that the `/healthz` endpoint is not available on the server.\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n1. **Verify the Liveness Probe Path**: Ensure that the application running in the container serves a health check endpoint at `/healthz`. If not, update the liveness probe to point to the correct path.\n2. **Implement a Health Check Endpoint**: If the application does not have a health check endpoint, consider adding one that returns a 200 status code when the application is healthy.\n3. **Update the Deployment Configuration**: Modify the deployment to reflect the correct liveness probe path or add the necessary endpoint in the application.\n\nIf you need further assistance with updating the configuration or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
