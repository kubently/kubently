      "The pod `missing-configmap-deployment-56f64d6d65-gpz9p` in the `test-scenario-04` namespace is failing to start due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Pending Status**: The pod is in a `Pending` state because it cannot be scheduled on any node.\n\n2. **Failed Scheduling**: The scheduler is unable to place the pod on any node due to a taint on the available node(s). Specifically, the node has a taint `{app: critical}` which the pod does not tolerate.\n\n3. **ConfigMap Issue**: The pod is trying to use a ConfigMap named `app-config` which is marked as non-optional. If this ConfigMap is missing, it could also prevent the pod from starting, although the primary issue here seems to be the scheduling problem.\n\nTo resolve this, you may need to:\n- Check if the ConfigMap `app-config` exists in the `test-scenario-04` namespace.\n- Either remove the taint from the node or add a toleration to the pod to allow it to be scheduled on the node with the taint `{app: critical}`."
