      "The service `web-service` in the `test-scenario-14` namespace is configured as a `ClusterIP` service with an IP of `10.96.191.8` and is supposed to route traffic to port `8080/TCP`. However, there are no endpoints associated with this service, which means it is not currently routing traffic to any pods.\n\nHere are some steps to debug and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Pod Labels**: Ensure that there are pods with the label `app=web` in the `test-scenario-14` namespace. The service uses this label to select its endpoints.\n\n2. **Pod Status**: Verify that the pods with the label `app=web` are running and healthy.\n\n3. **Network Policies**: Check if there are any network policies in place that might be blocking traffic to the pods.\n\n4. **Pod Logs and Events**: Review the logs and events for the pods to identify any issues that might prevent them from being ready.\n\nWould you like me to check for pods with the label `app=web` in the `test-scenario-14` namespace?"
