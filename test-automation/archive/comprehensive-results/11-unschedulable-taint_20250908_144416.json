      "It seems there was an error in retrieving the pod \"test-scenario-11\" because it was not found in the \"test-scenario-11\" namespace. However, I found some relevant events related to a pod scheduling issue:\n\n- **FailedScheduling**: The pod `no-toleration-deployment-6fdc58944f-9wbq2` is unable to be scheduled because there are no available nodes that can tolerate the taint `{app: critical}`. This means that the nodes have a taint that the pod does not tolerate, preventing it from being scheduled.\n\n- **Preemption**: The preemption process is not helpful for scheduling, indicating that even attempting to preempt other pods would not resolve the scheduling issue.\n\nTo resolve this, you may need to:\n1. Check the node taints and ensure that the pod has the necessary tolerations to be scheduled on the available nodes.\n2. Consider adjusting the taints on the nodes or adding the required tolerations to the pod specification.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific details, let me know!"
