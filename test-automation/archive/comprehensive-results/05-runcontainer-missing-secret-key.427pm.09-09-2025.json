      "The pod `missing-secret-key-deployment-646749c486-5c2xg` in the `test-scenario-05` namespace is failing to start due to a `CreateContainerConfigError`. The specific issue is that the container is trying to access a key named `api-key` from a Kubernetes Secret named `app-secret`, but this key is missing.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Check the Secret:**\n   - Verify that the Secret `app-secret` exists in the `test-scenario-05` namespace.\n   - Ensure that the Secret contains the key `api-key`.\n\n2. **Update the Secret:**\n   - If the Secret is missing the `api-key`, you need to add it. You can do this by creating or updating the Secret with the correct key-value pair.\n\n3. **Redeploy the Pod:**\n   - After updating the Secret, the pod should automatically restart and pick up the new Secret values. If not, you may need to manually delete the pod to trigger a new deployment.\n\nWould you like guidance on how to update the Secret or any other assistance?"
