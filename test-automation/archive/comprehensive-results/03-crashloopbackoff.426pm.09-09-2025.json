      "The pod `crash-loop-deployment-5b6868bffb-4kvtf` in the `test-scenario-03` namespace is experiencing a crash loop due to the following command in its container:\n\n```sh\nsh -c \"echo 'I am failing' && exit 1\"\n```\n\n### Issue:\n- The container is explicitly set to fail by executing a command that exits with a status code of 1, which causes the pod to restart repeatedly.\n\n### Solution:\n- Modify the container's command to prevent it from exiting with a non-zero status. For example, you can change the command to a long-running process or a command that exits successfully.\n\n### Example Fix:\nIf the intention is to keep the container running, you might replace the command with something like:\n```yaml\ncommand: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"while true; do echo 'Running...'; sleep 30; done\"]\n```\n\nThis change will keep the container running indefinitely by printing \"Running...\" every 30 seconds. Adjust the command according to the actual application logic you want to implement."
