2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing code style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 20+ (for CLI)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (Kind, Minikube, or cloud provider)
- kubectl configured

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kubently.git
   cd kubently
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Python dependencies
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

   # Node.js CLI dependencies
   cd kubently-cli/nodejs
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ../..
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   # Start Redis
   docker-compose up -d redis

   # Start API server
   make run-local

   # In another terminal, start A2A server
   make run-a2a
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run Python tests
pytest kubently/tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=kubently kubently/tests/

# Run linting
make lint

# Run type checking
make typecheck
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests are deterministic and don't depend on external services when possible
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions

## Code Style

### Python Code Style

We use `ruff` for Python linting and formatting:

```bash
# Format code
ruff format kubently/

# Check for issues
ruff check kubently/

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix kubently/
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript Code Style

We use `prettier` and `eslint` for Node.js code:

```bash
cd kubently-cli/nodejs
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits specification:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add support for custom kubectl commands
fix: resolve race condition in session management
docs: update API documentation for auth endpoints
```
