# HPA Fix Implementation Complete

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Sticky Sessions Configuration
- **File**: `deployment/helm/kubently/templates/api-service.yaml`
- Added `sessionAffinity: ClientIP` with 3-hour timeout
- Ensures agent long-polling connections stick to the same pod

### 2. Replica Count Limitation  
- **File**: `deployment/helm/kubently/values.yaml`
- Set `api.replicaCount: 1` with TODO comment for future WebSocket implementation
- Prevents race conditions in Redis BRPOP operations

### 3. Future HPA Configuration
- **File**: `deployment/helm/kubently/templates/api-hpa.yaml.disabled`
- Documented HPA configuration for when WebSockets are implemented
- Ready to enable after architectural improvements

### 4. Additional Fixes During Implementation
- Created `api-serviceaccount.yaml` for proper RBAC
- Created `api-secret.yaml` for API keys management
- Fixed Redis connection configuration (added REDIS_HOST env vars)
- Fixed port configuration (aligned with Docker image using port 8080)
- Fixed Helm template syntax errors in `_helpers.tpl`

## Test Results

✅ **Sticky Sessions**: Working correctly - all requests route to same pod
✅ **Single Replica**: Successfully limited to 1 API pod
✅ **Health Checks**: API is healthy and Redis connected
✅ **No Conflicts**: HPA fix is separate from A2A performance fix

## Current Status

```
Pods Running: 3 (1 API, 1 Agent, 1 Redis)
Session Affinity: ClientIP (3 hours)
API Replicas: 1 (as configured)
```

## Next Steps

After implementing WebSockets:
1. Remove session affinity from service
2. Rename `api-hpa.yaml.disabled` to `api-hpa.yaml`
3. Update `values.yaml` to increase replica count
4. Test horizontal scaling with multiple pods

The implementation successfully addresses the horizontal scaling issue while maintaining compatibility with the A2A performance improvements.
