# ARCHIVED: Multi-Node Graph Architecture Implementation

**Status:** Implemented
**Date Archived:** 2025-09-08

## Summary

Successfully refactored the Kubently A2A agent from a single ReAct agent into a robust, two-node cyclical graph using LangGraph. The new architecture separates data gathering (Diagnostician node) from synthesis and decision-making (Judge node).

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **prompts/judge.prompt.yaml** - Created new system prompt for the Judge node
2. **kubently/modules/config/prompts.py** - Modified to support flexible prompt file loading
3. **kubently/modules/a2a/protocol_bindings/a2a_server/agent.py** - Completely refactored to implement LangGraph architecture

### Key Changes

1. **Judge System Prompt**: Created a dedicated prompt for root cause analysis and decision-making
2. **Pydantic Model**: Added `JudgeDecision` model for structured output from Judge node
3. **Prompt Loader**: Made more flexible to load different prompt files (system.prompt.yaml, judge.prompt.yaml)
4. **LangGraph Implementation**:
   - Created `GraphState` TypedDict for state management
   - Implemented `diagnostician_node_runnable` for data gathering
   - Implemented `judge_node_runnable` for synthesis
   - Added `judge_decision_router` for conditional routing
   - Built graph with proper edges and compiled with memory support

### Architecture Overview

```
START → Diagnostician → Judge → (COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE decision)
                          ↓
                    If INCOMPLETE
                          ↓
                    Back to Diagnostician
```

### Known Issues Resolved

1. Fixed `create_react_agent` parameter from `messages_modifier` to `prompt`
2. Fixed `add_conditional_edge` to `add_conditional_edges` (plural)
3. Proper system prompt injection for Judge node

### Testing Status

- ✅ Code compiles and deploys successfully
- ✅ Graph structure properly initialized
- ⚠️ A2A endpoint integration testing incomplete due to JSON-RPC protocol requirements
- ⚠️ Full end-to-end testing pending OpenAI API key configuration

### Next Steps

1. Configure OpenAI API key for full functionality testing
2. Complete A2A protocol integration testing
3. Add comprehensive error handling for graph execution
4. Implement metrics and observability for graph nodes
5. Add unit tests for graph components

### Coding Agent Implementation Prompt

**Persona:** You are an expert Python developer specializing in building advanced, cyclical AI agents using LangGraph. You are meticulous about state management, prompt engineering, and creating robust, self-correcting graphs.

**Primary Goal:** Refactor the Kubently A2A agent from a single ReAct agent into a robust, two-node cyclical graph within LangGraph. This graph will consist of a **"Diagnostician"** node (to gather data) and a **"Judge"** node (to synthesize data and decide the next step), enabling cyclical troubleshooting.
